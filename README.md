*Problem Statement:*
To Create a Drawing_App

# Simple easy to use basic drawing application.

Proposed Solution :
Many times when things are not easy to explain we need visual support or sketches to represent, this can be solved with this application(small scale).

The App has a very simple and interactive interface that helps to draw on a canvas using your favorite colors.

Screen Layouts: The project uses a variety of layouts having their own functionality and improving the User Interface of the App. (Eg: Constraint Layout)
Simple & Easy Views Design: The use of interactive buttons makes it easier for students to choose their favorite brush font and color. App uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
Android Jetpack Library: We use the Android Jetpack Library of AndroidX which simplifies navigation implementation while also assisting in visualizing the navigation flow of our application.

#Minimal/Low Scale visualization at ant time anywhere with the application.
